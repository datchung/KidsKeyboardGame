# KidsKeyboardGame
Simple Kids Keyboard Game made with my kids.

# How it works
Press a key on the keyboard and the corresponding mapped sound will play. If no sound is mapped to the pressed key, then a default sound will be played.

# Why
* Fun afternoon activity with kids
* Let kids pick background pictures for the app (eg. Disney princesses)
* Let kids pick sounds to map to the keys (eg. songs, silly sounds via voice recorder)
* Teach kids about letters and numbers and typing on the keyboard
